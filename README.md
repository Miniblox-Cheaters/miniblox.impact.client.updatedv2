# Changelog

Re added fly, some of my testers still want it (including me)

.toggle all command (does not work, will be fixed soon)

Added better Scaffold bypass (module) by using a multi block scaffold (instead of just one inv space. It uses multiple inv slots from 1 - 9!)

LB CLICK GUI for now Implemented into (injection.js take a look)

# Installation

(M0duleMaster64's comment - Or use the main.js and manually put in the injection.js after the main)
