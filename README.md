# Impact Client v4 for MiniBlox

The ultimate MiniBlox hacked client! Built for stealth, speed, and total domination. Fully dark-mode optimized with a modern UI and high performance.

# EULA

BEFORE USING, Read EULA.md

# Changelog

Re added fly, some of my testers still want it (including me)

.toggle all command (does not work, will be fixed)

Added better Scaffold bypass (module) by using a multi block scaffold (instead of just one inv space. It uses multiple. I might add a video showing this.)

Added a basic ClickGUI (still some bugs) currently bound to key "\\" (Our Job is to make the GUI better than the basic!)

# Installation

Copy tampermonkey.user.js and paste into your preferred userscript manager. (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey etc)

(M0duleMaster64's comment - Or use the main.js and manually put in the injection.js after the main)

# Notes to M0duleMaster64

I re added fly bc it can be still useful at times, and i think tokeniser.js is ready for use

(M0duleMaster64's reply - Oh ok got it!)
