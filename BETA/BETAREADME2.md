@ModuleMaster64: Delete this line: All changes i. this beta folder are ready to be merged. Tokeniser is to get more tokens, try implementing that, and also maybe u could add a sessionStealee feature that steals the session id of all playes in the server around u in ur eender



This is the beta section of where i will put code (for modules that i have updated myself) out without harming the main branches. If you put anything in BETA i will test it and give you feedback! 

fab client fr (apart from hooking ofc lmao) :-)
